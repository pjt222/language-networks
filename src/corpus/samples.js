    text: `Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought Alice without pictures or conversations So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her There was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself Oh dear Oh dear I shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on Alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge In another moment down went Alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next First she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled Orange Marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it Well thought Alice to herself after a fall like this I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave they will all think me at home Why I would not say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house Which was very likely true Down down down Would the fall never come to an end I wonder how many miles I have fallen by this time she said aloud I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth Let me see that would be four thousand miles down I think for you see Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her it was good practice to say it over Yes that is about the right distance but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I have got to Alice had no idea what Latitude was or Longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say Presently she began again I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth How funny it will be to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward The Antipathies I think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it did not sound at all the right word but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know Please Maam is this New Zealand or Australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you are falling through the air Do you think you could manage it And what an ignorant little girl she will think me for asking No it will never do to ask perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere`,

    text: `Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Träumen erwachte fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheueren Ungeziefer verwandelt Er lag auf seinem panzerartig harten Rücken und sah wenn er den Kopf ein wenig hob seinen gewölbten braunen durch bogenförmige Versteifungen geteilten Bauch auf dessen Höhe sich die Bettdecke zum völligen Niedergleiten bereit kaum noch erhalten konnte Seine vielen im Vergleich zu seinem sonstigen Umfang kläglich dünnen Beine flimmerten ihm hilflos vor den Augen Was ist mit mir geschehen dachte er Es war kein Traum Sein Zimmer ein richtiges nur etwas zu kleines Menschenzimmer lag ruhig zwischen den vier wohlbekannten Wänden Über dem Tisch auf dem eine auseinandergepackte Musterkollektion von Tuchwaren ausgebreitet war hing das Bild das er vor kurzem aus einer illustrierten Zeitschrift ausgeschnitten und in einem hübschen vergoldeten Rahmen untergebracht hatte Es stellte eine Dame dar die mit einem Pelzhut und einer Pelzboa versehen aufrecht dasaß und einen schweren Pelzmuff der ihren ganzen Unterarm verschwand dem Beschauer entgegenhob Gregors Blick richtete sich dann zum Fenster und das trübe Wetter man hörte Regentropfen auf das Fensterbrett aufschlagen machte ihn ganz melancholisch Wie wäre es wenn ich noch ein wenig weiterschliefe und alle Narrheiten vergäße dachte er aber das war gänzlich undurchführbar denn er war gewöhnt auf der rechten Seite zu schlafen konnte sich aber in seinem gegenwärtigen Zustand nicht in diese Lage bringen Mit welcher Kraft er sich auch auf die rechte Seite warf immer wieder schaukelte er in die Rückenlage zurück Er versuchte es wohl hundertmal schloss die Augen um die zappelnden Beine nicht sehen zu müssen und ließ erst ab als er in der Seite einen noch nie gefühlten leichten dumpfen Schmerz zu fühlen begann Ach Gott dachte er was für ein anstrengendes Geschäft habe ich mir ausgesucht Tag für Tag auf Reisen Das geschäftliche Treiben ist viel größer als im eigentlichen Geschäft dazu kommen noch die Plage des Reisens die Sorgen um die Zuganschlüsse das unregelmäßige schlechte Essen ein immer wechselnder nie andauernder nie herzlich werdender menschlicher Verkehr Der Teufel soll das alles holen Er fühlte ein leichtes Jucken oben auf dem Bauch schob sich auf dem Rücken langsam näher zum Bettpfosten um den Kopf besser heben zu können fand die juckende Stelle die mit lauter kleinen weißen Pünktchen besetzt war die er nicht zu beurteilen verstand und wollte die Stelle mit einem Bein betasten zog es aber gleich zurück denn bei der Berührung umwehten ihn Kälteschauer`,
